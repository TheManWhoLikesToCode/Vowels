Hello User,

Here you will find programs that prints the number of vowels in a string

Methods
Vowel = N/A Base for other builds
Vowel_1 = Uses If & input.CharAt(i) 
Vowel_2 = Uses for and if "x".indexOf(input.charAt(i) !=-1)

Notes: You can also use if else to be more effective that listed methods
you can also use switch
